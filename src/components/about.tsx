          About
        </h2>
        <p>
          Results-driven software developer with a unique blend of enterprise
          technologies and cyber auditing acumen and expertise. Leveraging a
          strong academic foundation in Accounting & Finance and professional
          experience in IT Audit and Cyber Security, I bring an analytical
          approach to problem-solving in software development with the aim of
          building resilient and solid digital products. Having developed code
          as a personal endeavour for over five years, I recently completed an
          intensive Codeworks Software Engineering bootcamp, expanding my
          experience with JavaScript, React.js, Next.js, and Express.js towards
          product innovation at scale. I am eager to apply my diverse skill set
          and passion for continuous learning to make an immediate impact in a
          dynamic development team.
